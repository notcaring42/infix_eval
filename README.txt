Basic Usage
-----------
To use, run 'python infix_eval/main.py'. This program uses Python 3
and requires PyQt5 to be installed. You also need to add this folder
to your PYTHONPATH, or place it in site-packages.

Simply enter an infix expression into the "Expression" field and press
"Evaluate". It will then create the binary expression tree and output
it and the numerical result above.
